# Coding Challenges

I love trying to build things so I've been following along with the https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro
coding challenges. The thing I like about these is that none of them are trivial. You are building challenging
projects like a Redis clone, etc.

Currently all of these are in NodeJS. I may come back and do a Python version.

I am collecting them all here if anyone wants to see.
